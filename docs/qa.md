### Critical Path

- [ ]   `torus orgs create [name]` prompts you to confirm the org name, and creates it
- [ ]   `torus projects create [name] —org [org]` prompts you to confirm the project name, and creates it
- [ ]   `torus services create [name] —project [project] —org [org]` creates a service.
- [ ]   `torus set [key] [value] —service [service]` will set the variable
- [ ]  You can set using environment variables (e.g. `TORUS_ORG`)
- [ ]  You can not set variables in services that do not exist
- [ ]   `torus set [path] [value]` will set the variable
- [ ]   `torus view —service [service]` will list secrets
- [ ]  A secret can be set across services
- [ ]  A secret can be set across environments
- [ ]  More specific paths win
- [ ]  Latest set wins
- [ ]   `torus run <command> —service [service]` will inject secrets and execute the command
- [ ]   `torus run <command>` without a service defaults to "default" service
- [ ]   `torus unset [key] —service [service]` will unset the variable
- [ ] `torus template` can be used to derive a configuration file
